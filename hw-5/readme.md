# HW-5 -- Animation & Variables

For this week, I wanted my little character to be a bit more interactive, I also want to learn how to make it swing like a pendulum, but for now I am making it spin.

- utilize p5 reserved word variables, such as `mouseX`,
- declare and use my own variables,
- explore simple variable math,
- and create a sketch that moves around the page.

## Difficulties

I found putting the in the values for making my character to move is a bit tricky but I managed to get it to how I want it to move.
Next time I want to be able to make it move by swinging it by the string like a pendulum with the same sort of velocity.
