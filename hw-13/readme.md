I am going to expand more on my previous homework assignment.
[Live Sketch Link] (https://yewtreedesign.github.io/120-work/hw-10/)

I want to make collision detection with the seals that get angry when they get poked, and not have them overlap. Which still remains a challenge for me to accomplish.

Just looking back on what I have made inspired me to push what I have done a bit further. I know how to use a variable and what it's value is. It's just mixing it with other formulas poses a challenge for me. If that makes any sense.

I need to figure out how the seals should react if they are a pixel from each other
and I want them not to overlap.
