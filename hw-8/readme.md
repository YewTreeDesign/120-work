Okay! I finally figured out how to make an image move across the screen like a
pendulum by looking into the coding.

replace the value of the shape in to image instead and I had to make sure my Var.
would world with in the preload function.

What I would like to do is make my character to do an animation whenever it swings!

I will give my self a pat on the back that I finally did what I wanted to do for awhile.
