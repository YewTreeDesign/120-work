# HW-6 Example for MART120 - Creative Coding

This algorithmic piece that uses pointillize squares(rect) by mimicing the appearance of the preloaded image (des.jpg). the squares are randomnized I also used ceil to change the size of the squares when you move your crusor across the window (smaller to the left, bigger to the right).

The rendering would begin once the crusor is placed on the canvas.
